# Planner App
An application to organize and plan my day. The fifth assignment in my coding bootcamp.

## Description
This webpage is used to organize events throughout the work day. It displays the date in the header, and timeblocks for every hour in the standard work day (9am-5pm). The timeblocks are color-coded for past, present, and future, based on the time of day.
